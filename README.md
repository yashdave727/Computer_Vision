Projects on Computer Vision

## Intro

This repository consists of pdfs that have been generated using an interactive python notebook.

## Where’s Waldo

Created a program that using pixel data processing algorithms in computer vision, such as correlation and convolution, on an image of a Where’s Waldo book to locate Waldo. The project was done using a Python Notebook, and used SciPy, cv2, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Homography Generator

Given an image of two identical shapes (i.e. a picture of a computer screen/door at an obscured angle, and a shape similar to the computer screen of the same angle) generated a Homography that warps the image to fit the computer screen so the contents of the screen can be visible.

## Image Stitching Using Homography 

Given two images of the same place taken at different angles, stitches the two images to create a broader panoramic view by taking keypoints of images, using Random Sampling Consensus to find best matches, and generating a Homography for the best stitch.
